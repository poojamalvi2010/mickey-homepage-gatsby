                    The Mickey website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie
                    is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run
                    programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only
                    be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

                </p>
                <p>

                    One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The
                    purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For
                    example, if you personalize Mickey pages, or register with Mickey site or services, a cookie helps
                    Mickey to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of
                    recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on.
                    When you return to the same Mickey website, the information you previously provided can be
                    retrieved, so you can easily use the Mickey features that you customized.
